## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer's service discovery mechanism. During the deployment, the new configuration failed to properly register backend services, causing the load balancer to route traffic to non-existent endpoints.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Insufficient Testing**: The deployment process lacked comprehensive integration testing for load balancer configuration changes.

2. **Monitoring Gaps**: Health check failures were not immediately visible in our primary monitoring dashboard.

3. **Rollback Complexity**: The rollback procedure required manual intervention and took longer than expected due to configuration complexity.

4. **Communication Delays**: Initial response was delayed due to unclear escalation procedures during off-hours.

### Technical Details

**Load Balancer Configuration Issue:**
```yaml
# Problematic configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: api-gateway
    version: v2.1.3  # This selector was incorrect
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

**Service Discovery Failure:**
- Kubernetes service discovery failed to resolve backend pods
- Load balancer received empty endpoint list
- Traffic routed to non-existent services

**DNS Resolution Issues:**
- Internal DNS queries for service discovery timing out
- Kubernetes DNS cache corruption
- Network connectivity issues between load balancer and Kubernetes API
